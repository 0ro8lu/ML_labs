This repository contains the laboratory exercises with discussions of the Machine Learning course (2022/23) at the Master's degree in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome.

The coding environment is Google Colab so that students don't have to configure a designated environment with specific Python packages.

The syllabus of the laboratory courses is:

## Data feature pre-processing
Data cleaning - missing, inconsistend, and noisy data.

Missing values - univariate vs multivariate, and nearest neighbour imputation

Feature scaling - standard, min-max, max-abs scaling, or mapping to uniform/Gaussian distributions

Feature normalisation

Encoding - pitfalls of encoding categorical data, embeddings (CBOW, Skip-gram)

Feature discretisation - k-bins,  feature binarisation

Label/class balancing - up-sample minority class vs down-sample majority class, and advanced techniques
